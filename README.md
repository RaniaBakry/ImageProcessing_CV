# ImageProcessing_CV
This repository includes: 
1- Apply "Gaussian" and "salt and pepper" noise for an image using built in MATLAB fucntion.
2- Filtering this image using "Average","Gaussian" and "Median" Filters using built in MATLAB function.
3- Edge detection Using "Canny", "Sobel","Robert" and "prewitt" techniques using built in MATLAB function.
4- Hyprid Image using low pass filter(Gaussian filter). 
5- Draw histogram for image. 
6- Equalization for Image.
7- Normalization for Image. 
8- Apply Global and local thresholding. 
9- Apply freqancy domain filters (low and high pass filters). 
10- Draw Histogram for RGB channels each channel seperated.

There is GUI to run all of this.
